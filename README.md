# Hart et al. 2023 Fungal community composition in coarse woody debris manuscript
 
Scripts + infiles for statistics, figures and tables found in the manuscript "Fungal community dynamics in coarse woody debris across decay stage, tree species, and stand development stage in northern boreal forests" (Hart et al. 2023)

## Infiles

- BigSampleMapWood.csv, BigSampleMapWood2.csv, and sampleMapregionspecies.csv are all mapping files used in all R scripts.

- compactenvapril2021.csv is a mapping file of condensed environmental parameters used in AICc modelling.

- PCOA2.csv contained PCoA axes values for AICc modelling.

- Saskia_fITS74R_fITS94R_taxonomy.csv is used across the majority of scripts for processing of ESVs. Used to create Figures 2, 3, and 4, as well as AICc modelling. 

- funGUILD.1.guilds.txt and funGUILD.2.guilds(1).txt are files taken from http://www.funguild.org/ after submitting our fungal data for ecological guild analysis and were used to create Figure 5.
